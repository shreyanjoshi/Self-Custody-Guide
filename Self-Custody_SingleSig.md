# The procedure for self-custody of Bitcoin using a Hot Wallet in 3 simple steps:

## Step 1: Choose a Standard Wallet App and Generate a New Wallet.
    To begin Self-Custody of your Bitcoin, you need to choose a Standard Bitcoin Wallet App. These are wallets which are open-source software, reputable, and battlefield tested for security.
    We recommend using Blockstream Green. Install it from the Play Store or the App Store. Follow the instructions in the App to set up your wallet:   
    a) Open the App and click on "+ Add Wallet".
    b) Now, click on "+ New Wallet".
    c) Now, click on Bitcoin under Choose Your Network.
    d) Now, click on Singlesig under Choose Security Policy. Let the Recovery phrase length be default set to 12.
    e) Now, before you click on Next, please go through the three warnings under Back Up Recovery Phrase.
    f) Now, Write down the 12 word mnemonic phrase in the correct sequence using pen and paper. This sequence of words is used to backup your wallet to recover in the future.
       Do not write/store them online and do noy take its picture to protect yourself from hackers. Click on Next.
    g) Now, select the correct word from the sequence of your mnemonic from the options under Check your backup.
    h) Now, choose a name for your wallet under Wallet name and click on Next.
    i) Now, Set a PIN. Click on Next, and Verify Your PIN. 
    j) Your Wallet is now Set Up!. Click on Explore Your Wallet.
   
    You are now eady to receive Bitcoin. 

## Step 2: Transfer/Receive Bitcoin.
    Transfer your Bitcoin from exchanges or receive from a sender by clicking on receive, and sending the generated Bitcoin address generated by your wallet software. 
    Be careful when copying and pasting Bitcoin addresses to avoid any mistakes, as transactions on the Bitcoin network are irreversible.

## Step 3: Create Multiple Back Ups of Your Wallet
    It is important that you create multiple back ups of your Wallet, ie backup your 12 word mnemonic to protect yourself from all kinds of vulnerabilities and risks like loss, theft, disasters etc.
    If you lose your mnemonic written down in Step 1, you lose the ability to recover your wallet, and hence if your mobile phone gets lost/stolen/damaged, you lose your money. 
    
    a) Create another back up of your wallet by writing your 12 word mnemonic in the correct sequence *offline* - either on paper or metal. 
    b) Keep the piece of paper/metal in a physically secure location. This location should be private, accessible only by you, and safe from theft, loss, damage by water, fire, natural disasters etc. 
       Example - Your private locker, basement of your house, your safety deposit box in bank etc.
    c) Create as many backups as you think are necessary to create redundancy. Keep them in different geographically separate locations. 
       It is recommended to start with one backup at a time and increase the number of backups when you feel safe you have sufficiently secured the location of your previous backups.
    d) Regularly keep checking the security of your backup locations making sure the location privacy is not compromised, the backups are not lost or stolen, not damaged by water, fire, or not destroyed in a natural disaster etc.
    e) You can also think of giving dividing your mnemonic in 2 pieces of six words each(or some other combination) and giving them to two trustworthy people in your life you trust to not collude to steal your money.

    These backups will allow you to recover your wallet in cases your mobile phone is missing, lost, stolen, or damaged. 

Self-custody of Bitcoin comes with the responsibility of securing your mnemonic and managing your backup locations. 
Self-custody always comes with a unique set of potential risks and vulnerabilities for each individual depending on their life situation, place of residence, risk appetite, personal ring of trust etc. 
Please take the required time and necessary precautions to ensure the security of your Bitcoin, ie, using Standard Wallets, keeping the mnemonic and backups private, and regularly checking your backup locations.
