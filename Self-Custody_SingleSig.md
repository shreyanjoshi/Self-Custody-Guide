# The procedure for self-custody of Bitcoin in 5 simple steps:

## Step 1: Choose a Standard Wallet.
    To begin Self-Custody of your Bitcoin, you need to choose a Standard Bitcoin Wallet that fits your needs. Some of the Standard Wallets are BlueWallet, Blockstream Green, Wasabi, ColdCard.
    Standard Bitcoin Wallets are wallet softwares which are open-source, reputable, and battlefield tested for security.

    There are two types of Bitcoin wallets: 1. Software wallets(mobile and desktop)
                                            2. Hardware wallets
    Each has its own pros and cons in terms of security, accessibility, and ease of use:

    1. Standard Software Wallets/Hot Wallets. 
    These are wallets which store your private keys on your mobile or desktop. 
    They should ONLY hold the amount of funds you want easy access to spend, since they are always vulnerable to attacks from malicious software updates and hackers. 

    * Standard Mobile wallets - Blue, Muun, Breez, Samourai, Green, Phoenix, Simple Bitcoin Wallet. Click here for a video on using BlueWallet.

    * Standard Desktop wallets - Wasabi, Sparrow, Bitcoin Core. Click here for a video on using Wasabi.   

    2. Standard Hardware Wallets/Cold Wallets. 
    These are  wallets which store your private keys on a device which never connects to the internet, hence 'cold'.
    They are used to secure your long-term savings, ie, funds NOT meant to be spent day-to-day.
    You can receive funds on these wallets easily setting up what are called Watch-only wallets. Click here to find out how to set up a Watch-only wallet.

    * Standard Hardware wallets - Coldcard, Tapsigner, Jade. Click here for a video on using a Coldcard.
   
    Download and install the wallet of your choice. Make sure to only download the wallet from trusted sources - Play Store, App Store and recognised websites.

## Step 2: Generate a New Wallet
    Create a new Bitcoin wallet using the wallet app by clicking on add Wallet. 
    The wallet will generate a unique Bitcoin Seed, which you can use to backup and recover the wallet. 

    You are now ready to receive Bitcoin. 

    * Most wallets also allow you to set up an optional passphrase, which is the 13th or 25th word used with your seed to recover the wallet. The optional passphrase is useful for multiple wallets management.
  You can use the optional passphrase(s) which is a word(s) or phrase(s) of your choice used ALONG with the seed to create new separate wallet(s).
  For example, a wallet with your seed phrase "Seed-1" is securing some funds, and you create multiple wallets with the seed phrases as "Seed-1" + passphrases such as 'Life-Savings', 'Recreation', 'Emergency funds', 'Decoy'.

    * Instead of securing the 12/24 words directly, you can highlight them in your favourite books and write down the page and paragraph numbers for reference. 
  You can also think of distributing your Seed into three pieces of 4 words each and giving each piece to trusted family members and friends you trust to not collude to cheat you.

    * You can use a metal plate instead of piece of paper if you think that paper is fragile and insecure to maintain. 
  
## Step 3: Transfer/Receive Bitcoin.
    Transfer your Bitcoin from exchanges or receive from a sender by clicking on receive, and sending the generated Bitcoin address generated by your wallet software. 
    Be careful when copying and pasting Bitcoin addresses to avoid any mistakes, as transactions on the Bitcoin network are irreversible.

## Step 4: Back Up Your Wallet
    It is critical to back up your wallet since losing Bitcoin is akin to losing a physical item. If you lose your seed phrase, you lose the ability to recover your wallet.
    Back up your wallet by securely storing your seed phrase(and optional passphrase) offline on as many pieces of paper as you deem fit and keep them in different physically secure locations.
    These locations should be private, accessible, safe from theft, loss, damage by water, fire, etc.
    These backups will allow you to recover your wallet in cases of wallet service being unavailaible, theft, loss, or damage of your device.

Remember, self-custody of Bitcoin comes always comes with a unique set of potential risks and vulnerabilities, and with the responsibility of securely managing your backups.
Take the required time and necessary precautions to ensure the security of your Bitcoin, ie, using the correct Wallets, keeping the seed phrase private, and regularly maintaining your backups.
