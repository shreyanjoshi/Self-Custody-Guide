# The procedure for self-custody of Bitcoin using a Hot Wallet in 3 simple steps:

## Step 1: Choose a Standard Wallet App and Generate a New Wallet.
    To begin Self-Custody of your Bitcoin, you need to choose a Standard Bitcoin Wallet App. These are wallets which are open-
    source software, reputable, and battlefield tested for security. We recommend using Green Wallet. Install it from the Play
    Store or the App Store on your mobile or download it from blockstream.com/green on your desktop. Follow the instructions 
    in the App to set up your wallet:   
    a) Open the App and click on "+ Add Wallet".
    b) Now, click on "+ New Wallet".
    c) Now, click on Bitcoin under Choose Your Network.
    d) Now, click on Singlesig under Choose Security Policy. Let the Recovery phrase length be default set to 12.
    e) Now, before you click on Next, please go through the three warnings under Back Up Recovery Phrase.
    f) Now, Write down the 12 word mnemonic phrase in the correct sequence using pen and paper. This sequence of words is used
       to backup your wallet to recover in the future. Do not write/store them online and do noy take its picture to protect 
       yourself from hackers. Click on Next.
    g) Now, select the correct word from the sequence of your mnemonic from the options under Check your backup.
    h) Now, choose a name for your wallet under Wallet name and click on Next.
    i) Now, Set a PIN. Click on Next, and Verify Your PIN. 
    j) Your Wallet is now Set Up!. Click on Explore Your Wallet.
   
    Remember that the mnemonic - the sequence of 12 words - IS your wallet. Security of your Bitcoin relies ONLY on keeping 
    the words safe and private. If your mobile/desktop is lost, stolen, or damaged, your Bitcoin can still be used by 
    recovering your wallet on a new device using the mnemonic. 
    It might seem that someone might guess your sequence of 12 words to steal your Bitcoin but the power of randomness of 12 
    words is not appreciated enough. The best supercomputers in the world cannot guess your mnemonic and steal your Bitcoin 
    thanks to entropy in guessing sequence of words.

    You are now ready to receive Bitcoin. 

## Step 2: Buy/Transfer/Receive Bitcoin.
    Buy/Transfer your Bitcoin from exchanges or receive from a sender by clicking on receive, and sending the generated Bitcoin
    address by your wallet to the exchange/sender. Be careful in sharing/copying and pasting the correct Bitcoin addresses to
    avoid any mistakes, as transactions on the Bitcoin network are irreversible.
    
    If you want to, you can receive a small amount to begin with and attempt recovery on a separate mobile phone or a different
    wallet app like Bluewallet to make sure you have written the mnemonic correctly.
    a) Receive Bitcoin by sending the address generated by your wallet to the sender.
    b) Delete your wallet and install Green again/Download a new wallet like BlueWallet/Use a seperate mobile or desktop.
    c) Recover your wallet using the mnemonic words by clicking on "Restore a Wallet" in Green, or "Import Wallet" in
    BlueWallet.

    If the recovery is successful, you are ready to receive any amount of Bitcoin securely with recovery in future!

## Step 3: Create Multiple Back Ups of Your Wallet
    It is important that you create multiple back ups of your wallet/mnemonic to protect yourself from risks to your only
    backup such as loss, theft, disasters etc. If you lose your mnemonic written down in Step 1, you lose the ability to 
    recover your wallet, and hence if your mobile phone gets lost/stolen/damaged, you lose your money. 
    
    a) Create another back up of your wallet by writing your mnemonic in the correct sequence *offline* - either on paper
       or metal. 
    b) Keep the piece of paper/metal in a physically secure location. This location should be private and safe from theft,
       damage by water, fire, natural disasters etc. Example - Your private locker, basement of your house, your safety
       deposit box in bank etc.
    c) Create as many backups as you think are necessary to create redundancy. Keep them in different geographically 
       separate locations. 
       It is recommended to start with one backup at a time and increase the number of backups when you feel safe you have
       sufficiently secured the location of your previous backups.
    d) Regularly keep checking the security of your backup locations making sure the location privacy is not compromised,
       the backups are not lost or stolen, not damaged by water, fire, or not destroyed in a natural disaster etc.
    e) You can also think of giving dividing your mnemonic in 2 pieces of six words each(or some other combination) and
       giving them to two trustworthy people in your life you trust to not collude to steal your money.

    These backups will allow you to recover your wallet in cases your mobile phone and first back up is missing, lost,
    stolen, or damaged. 

Self-custody of Bitcoin comes with the responsibility of securing your mnemonic and managing your backup locations. 
Self-custody always comes with a unique set of potential risks and vulnerabilities for each individual depending on their life situation, place of residence, risk appetite, personal ring of trust etc. 
Please take the required time and necessary precautions to ensure the security of your Bitcoin, ie, using Standard Wallets, keeping the mnemonic and backups private, and regularly checking your backup locations.
