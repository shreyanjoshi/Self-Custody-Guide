# Step-by-step Guide to using a Hot Wallet, with common risks and mistakes:

## Choose a Standard Wallet App and Create a New Wallet.
    To begin Self-Custody of your Bitcoin, you need to choose a Standard Bitcoin Wallet. These are wallets which are open-
    source software, reputable, and battlefield tested for security. We recommend using Green Wallet. Install it from the Play
    Store or the App Store on your mobile, or download it from blockstream.com/green on your desktop. Follow the instructions 
    in the app to set up your wallet:   
    a) Open the App and click on "+ Add Wallet".
    b) Now, click on "+ New Wallet".
    c) Now, click on Bitcoin under Choose Your Network.
    d) Now, click on Singlesig under Choose Security Policy. Let the Recovery phrase length be default set to 12.
    e) Now, before you click on Next, please go through the three warnings under Back Up Recovery Phrase.
    f) Now, write down the 12 word mnemonic phrase in the correct sequence using pen and paper. This sequence of words is used
       to backup your wallet to recover in the future. Do not write/store them online and do not take its picture to protect 
       yourself from hackers. Click on Next.
    g) Now, select the correct word from the sequence of your mnemonic from the options under Check your backup.
    h) Now, choose a name for your wallet under Wallet name and click on Next.
    i) Now, Set a PIN. The PIN protects you from an attacker in possession of your phone. Click on Next, and Verify Your PIN. 
    j) Your Wallet is now Set Up!. Click on Explore Your Wallet.
   
    Remember that the mnemonic - the sequence of 12 words - IS your wallet. Security of your Bitcoin relies ONLY on keeping 
    the words safe. If your mobile/desktop is lost, stolen, or damaged, your Bitcoin does not get lost and can be used by 
    recovering your wallet on a new device(mobile or desktop or cold wallet) using the mnemonic.

    Note: If you lose your mobile/desktop/backup or it is stolen, you should immediately recover your wallet on a new device 
    and sweep all your funds to a new wallet with a new mnemonic by clicking on "Restore a Wallet" when you install and open
    Green. 

    It might seem that someone might guess your sequence of 12 words to steal your Bitcoin but the power of randomness of 12 
    words is not appreciated enough. The best supercomputers in the world cannot guess your mnemonic and steal your Bitcoin 
    thanks to entropy in guessing sequence of words.

    Note: Some wallets allow you to enter an additional passphrase which is the 13th or 25th word in addition to your mnemonic
    used when you want to recover your wallet. You can keep a passphrase if you feel securing just the mnemonic is insecure
    and you want an additional layer of security by keeping a secret passphrase, secured separately. 

    You are now ready to receive Bitcoin. 

## Buy/Receive Bitcoin.
    Buy/Transfer your Bitcoin from exchanges or receive from a sender by clicking on receive, and sending the generated Bitcoin
    address by your wallet to the exchange/sender. 

    Bitcoin addresses are like E-mail addresses, which can be publically shared to receive money from any sender. Although, it
    is a good practice to not reuse the same Bitcoin address to receive multiple payments to protect your privacy from
    anyone spying the Bitcoin blockchain.

    Transactions on the Bitcoin network are irreversible, so be careful and avoid mistakes while sharing or copying and pasting
    the correct address before sending them to the sender.

    If you want to, you can receive a small amount to begin with and attempt recovery on a separate mobile phone or a different
    wallet app like Bluewallet to make sure you have written the mnemonic correctly.
    a) Receive Bitcoin by sending the address generated by your wallet to the sender.
    b) Delete your wallet and install Green again/Download a new wallet like BlueWallet/Use a seperate mobile or desktop.
    c) Recover your wallet using the mnemonic words by clicking on "Restore a Wallet" in Green, or "Import Wallet" in
    BlueWallet.

    If the recovery is successful, you are ready to receive any amount of Bitcoin securely with recovery in future!

## Create Multiple Back Ups of Your Wallet(optional but recommended)
    It is important that you create multiple backups of your wallet/mnemonic to protect yourself from risks to your only 
    backup such as loss, theft, disasters etc. If you lose your mnemonic written down in Step 1, you lose the ability to 
    recover your wallet, and hence if your mobile phone gets lost/stolen/damaged, you lose your money. 
    
    a) Create another back up of your wallet by writing your mnemonic in the correct sequence offline - either on paper or
       metal. 
    b) Keep the piece of paper/metal in a physically secure location. This location should be private and safe from theft, 
       damage by water, fire, natural disasters etc. Example - Your private locker, basement of your house, your safety
       deposit box in bank etc.
    c) Create as many backups as you think are necessary to create redundancy. Keep them in different geographically 
       separate locations. It is recommended to start with one backup at a time and increase the number of backups when you
       feel safe you have sufficiently secured the location of your previous backups.
    d) Regularly keep checking the security of your backup locations making sure the privacy of the location is not
       compromised, the backups are not lost or stolen, not damaged by water, fire, or not destroyed in a natural disaster.
    e) You can also think of giving dividing your mnemonic in 2 pieces of six words each(or some other combination) and 
       giving them to two trustworthy people in your life you trust to not collude to steal your money.

    These backups will allow you to recover your wallet in cases your mobile phone and first back up is missing, lost, stolen,
    or damaged. 

Self-custody of Bitcoin comes with the responsibility of securing your mnemonic and managing your backup locations. 
Self-custody always comes with a unique set of potential risks and vulnerabilities for each individual depending on their life situation, place of residence, risk appetite, personal ring of trust etc. 
Please take the required time and necessary precautions to ensure the security of your Bitcoin, ie, using Standard Wallets, keeping the mnemonic and backups private, and regularly checking your backup locations.
